   * One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher.
   * In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
   * A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
   * Fix the function so it takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
   * All letters will be uppercase, with english 26 letter alphabet. Non-alphabetic should not be converted.
   * Related tests should be fixed
